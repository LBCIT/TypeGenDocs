About TypeGen
=============

TypeGen is a file generator that creates TypeScript source files based on C# classes or enums. The main goal of TypeGen is to allow for single-class-per-file generation for TypeScript sources.

There are many other tools that allow for converting C# classes or enums to their TypeScript counterparts. Such automatic source generation is very helpful when there is a need of keeping the same DTO classes for both C# and TypeScript, for example when consuming a web API. Most of the existing tools, however, allow only for generating multiple types per TypeScript file (grouped in either a module or a namespace). This is not ideal when a directory structure of TypeScript files needs to be preserved - for example when using a TypeScript-based framework.

The main goal of TypeGen is therefore to allow for single-class-per-file generation, which makes it useful when generating TypeScript sources with a defined directory structure.

Requirements
============

For .NET Standard compatibility, see `compatibility table <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library>`_.

**Versions >= 1.5.7**

* CLI: .NET Core 2.0
* TypeGen.Core: .NET Standard versions: 1.3 and 2.0

**Versions 1.5.0 - 1.5.6**

* CLI: .NET Framework 4.6
* TypeGen.Core: .NET Standard 1.3

**Versions <= 1.4.x**

.NET Framework 4.0

Features
========

TypeGen consists of two components: a core library (contains logic for file generation) and a Command Line Interface that utilizes the file generation logic. In most cases, the CLI should provide enough functionality to generate TypeScript sources as needed. In more complex cases, there is a possibility of using the core library file generation logic directly from your C# code. For more information about using the CLI, please refer to the :doc:`Command Line Interface <cli>` section. More details on using file generation directly from the C# code can be found in the :doc:`Programmatical usage <programmaticalusage>` section.

Among the TypeGen's features are:

* generating TypeScript classes, interfaces and enums - single class per file
* support for collection (or nested collection) property types
* generic classes/types generation
* support for inheritance
* customizable convertion between C#/TypeScript names (naming conventions)

How it works
============

The big picture is best illustrated by this diagram:

.. image:: images/big-picture.png

In short, TypeGen gets all C# classes/enums (annotated with appropriate attributes) from an assembly and generates corresponding TypeScript files for them in the file system.

Getting started
===============

To use TypeGen in your code or from the PM console, install the `NuGet package <https://www.nuget.org/packages/TypeGen>`_. After installation, both CLI and programmatical API will be available. Additionally, you may add `TypeGen for DotNet CLI <https://nuget.org/packages/TypeGen.DotNetCli>`_ to your project, or install TypeGen for DotNetCli as a global tool.

Quick example
=============

Let's say you have a *ProductDto* class that you want to export to TypeScript. You first need to mark the class as exportable to TypeScript:

.. code-block:: csharp

	using TypeGen.Core.TypeAnnotations;

	[ExportTsClass]
	public class ProductDto
	{
	    public decimal Price { get; set; }
	    public string[] Tags { get; set; }
	}

After building your project, type into the Package Manager Console:

.. code-block:: text

	TypeGen ProjectFolder

...where *ProjectFolder* is your project folder, relative to your solution directory.

This will generate a single TypeScript file (named *product-dto.ts*) in your project directory. The file will look like this:

.. code-block:: typescript

	export class ProductDto {
	    price: number;
	    tags: string[];
	}
