About TypeGen
=============

TypeGen is a file generator that creates TypeScript source files based on C# classes or enums. The main goal of TypeGen is to allow for single-class-per-file generation for TypeScript sources.

There are many other tools that allow for converting C# classes or enums to their TypeScript counterparts. Such automatic source generation is very helpful when there is a need of keeping the same DTO classes for both C# and TypeScript, for example when consuming a web API. Most of the existing tools, however, allow only for generating multiple types per TypeScript file (grouped in either a module or a namespace). This is not ideal when a directory structure of TypeScript files needs to be preserved - for example when using a TypeScript-based framework.

The main goal of TypeGen is therefore to allow for single-class-per-file generation, which makes it useful when generating TypeScript sources with a defined directory structure.

Features
========

TypeGen consists of two components: a core library (contains logic for file generation) and a Command Line Interface that utilizes the file generation logic. In most cases, the CLI should provide enough functionality to generate TypeScript sources as needed. In more complex cases, there is a possibility of using the core library file generation logic directly from your C# code. For more information about using the CLI, please refer to the :doc:`Command Line Interface <cli>` section. More details on using file generation directly from the C# code can be found in the :doc:`Programmatical API <programmaticalapi>` section.

Main TypeGen's features include:

* generating TypeScript classes, interfaces and enums - single class per file
* support for collection (or nested collection) property types
* generic classes/types generation
* support for inheritance
* customizable convertion between C#/TypeScript names (naming conventions)

Complete list of features added in each release is specified in the `changelog <http://jburzynski.net/TypeGen/changelog>`_.

How it works
============

The big picture is best illustrated by this diagram:

.. image:: images/big-picture.png

In short, TypeGen gets selected C# classes/enums from an assembly and generates corresponding TypeScript files for them in the file system.

Since TypeGen takes a .NET assembly, in theory it is also possible to provide an assembly written in a different language than C#. However, TypeGen is only tested with C# code.

Getting started
===============

To use TypeGen in your code or from the Package Manager Console, install the `NuGet package <https://www.nuget.org/packages/TypeGen>`_. After installation, both CLI and programmatical API will be available. Alternatively, you may also use TypeGen as a `.NET CLI global tool <https://nuget.org/packages/TypeGen.DotNetCli>`_.

Quick example
=============

Let's say you have a *ProductDto* class that you want to export to TypeScript. You first need to mark the class as exportable to TypeScript. You can do this either with attributes or a generation spec:

.. code-block:: csharp

    //attributes
    
    [ExportTsClass]
    public class ProductDto
    {
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
        public string[] Tags { get; set; }
    }
    
    // generation spec
    
    public class MyGenerationSpec : GenerationSpec
    {
        public MyGenerationSpec()
        {
            AddClass<ProductDto>();
        }
    }

After building your project, type :code:`TypeGen generate` into the Package Manager Console (you might have to restart Visual Studio), or :code:`dotnet typegen generate` in the system console if you're using TypeGen .NET CLI tool. If you're using generation specs, you should also add your spec(s) in `tgconfig.json` under the `generationSpecs` parameter (more details in :doc:`CLI | configuration file section <cli>`).

This will generate a single TypeScript file (named *product-dto.ts*) in your project directory. The file will look like this:

.. code-block:: typescript

	export class ProductDto {
	    price: number;
	    tags: string[];
	}
